Sculpt Tool Kit is well, a kit which contains the following tools

* Boolean Tools
* Remeshing Tools
* Mesh Simplification
* Solid mesh cutting
* A sculpt mask deform
* Basemesh generation (Envelope armature to mesh).
* Full control over solid lights with use of presets
* A nice pie menu that englobes the whole addon

Ps.
Since with the new Blender 2.8 many of the features contained in this addon will no longer be necessary, I plan to include advanced retopology tools, that allow for not only fast but semi-automatic quad placing with field guidelines.
